## Project Status
- **FrontEnd**: Pending
- **BackEnd**: Completed with Spring Security

**Important Note**: The H2 database was not functioning properly with security applied, so MySQL is used instead. Ensure you have a MySQL database with a username and password set up.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Run as Spring Boot Application**
   - Open your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).
   - Import the project.
   - Run the application as a Spring Boot project.

2. **API Testing**
   - Use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for API testing.
   - Ensure your MySQL database is running and accessible.

## Database Configuration

Make sure to update your `application.properties` file with your MySQL database credentials:
copy paste from : application.properties
